# Getting started NAMJAESOO

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) can automatically generate and serve the website for you.
Let's say you have a username/organisation `my-org` and project `my-proj`; if you locate Jekyll source under `blog` folder of master branch in your repo `github.com/my-org/my-proj`, the website will be served on `my-org.github.io/my-proj`.

1. Just download or fork and clone the source from [github.com/janczizikow/sleek](https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek/).
2. Make sure your local machine has ruby and node
3. Edit site settings in  `_config.yml` file according to your project.
4. Replace `favicons` and `_includes/logo.svg` with your own logo.

```yaml

layout: post # needs to be post
title: Getting Started with Sleek # title of your post
featured-img: sleek #optional - if you want you can include hero image
---

```



### MathJax

If you want to use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in your posts, add `mathjax: true` in [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) of your post:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: Blog Post with MathJax
featured-img: sleek # optional - if you want you can include name of hero image
mathjax: true # add this line in order to enable MathJax in the post
---
```

#### Example

In N-dimensional simplex noise, the squared kernel summation radius $r^2$ is $\frac 1 2$
for all values of N. This is because the edge length of the N-simplex $s = \sqrt {\frac {N} {N + 1}}$
divides out of the N-simplex height $h = s \sqrt {\frac {N + 1} {2N}}$.
The kerel summation radius $r$ is equal to the N-simplex height $h$.

$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$
Happy hacking!
